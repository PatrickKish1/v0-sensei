# 🌟 Sensei - Decentralized Knowledge Economy Platform

**Empowering Retirees & Experts Through AI-Powered Knowledge Sharing**


Sensei is a revolutionary decentralized platform that creates a thriving economy around knowledge sharing, where retirees and experts can register as "Senseis," create AI clones of themselves, and share their skills with the world forever. Students can book lessons, mint NFTs of their learning experiences, and participate in a knowledge-backed economy.

## 🎯 Revolutionary Vision

Sensei is a revolutionary Web3 platform that enables knowledge sharing through AI personas and blockchain-based monetization. The platform allows experts (Senseis) to create AI replicas of themselves and monetize their knowledge while students can learn from these AI mentors and earn/spend SensiTokens.

### Key Features

- **Role-Based Authentication**: Users choose between Sensei (expert) or Student roles
- **Wallet Integration**: Support for MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Coinbase Wallet
- **Sensei Registration**: Comprehensive onboarding for experts with profile creation
- **AI Persona Creation**: Transform your expertise into interactive AI replicas
- **Knowledge Economy**: Earn and spend SensiTokens through learning interactions
- **Lesson NFTs**: Mint and burn lesson NFTs with 50/50 revenue split
- **Categorized Marketplace**: Browse senseis by expertise categories
- **Token Management**: Built-in wallet for minting/burning SensiTokens

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Sensei Registration & AI Cloning
```
Retiree/Expert → Register as Sensei → AI Replica Created → Knowledge Upload (Zama Encrypted)
```

### 2. No-Registration Student Booking
```
Anyone → Book Lesson (ETH/Any ERC20 Token) → Payment Escrowed → Sensei Accepts/Declines
```

### 3. Session & NFT Creation
```
Session Completed → Payment Released → Lesson NFT Created → Choose Public/Private
```

### 4. NFT Marketplace & Revenue Split
```
Anyone Mints NFT → Pay SenseiTokens → 50% to Sensei + 45% to Student + 5% Platform Fee
```

### 5. Knowledge-Backed Token Economics
```
More Sessions + NFTs → Higher Knowledge Value → Increased Token Value → Economy Growth
```
